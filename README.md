🚀 Job Role Prediction Project

📖 Overview

This project is part of my Infosys Internship and aims to predict suitable job roles for candidates based on their educational background, certifications, and skills using Machine Learning.
The work is divided into structured milestones, ensuring a systematic and professional approach from data preparation to final deployment.

🎯 Objectives

🟢 Predict job roles from resumes and candidate profiles

🟢 Build an end-to-end ML pipeline (data cleaning → feature engineering → model training → deployment)

🟢 Demonstrate strong knowledge of EDA, feature engineering, ML models, and deployment tools

🏆 Milestones
✅ Milestone 1 – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis

📓 Notebook: Infosys(M-1).ipynb

🔹 Collected and integrated datasets (Education, Certifications, Skills, Job Roles)

🔹 Cleaned and preprocessed the raw dataset

🔹 Handled missing values and standardized text fields

🔹 Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with meaningful visualizations

📌 Outputs:

🟡 Cleaned dataset ready for ML

🟡 EDA report notebook
